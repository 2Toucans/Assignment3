Colt King

Controls:
	Pan with 1 finger to move
	Pan with 2 fingers to turn

Notes:
    You can only toggle to controlling the horse when you are on the same tile as the horse
        You can toggle off of controlling the horse any time
    Double tapping to enable/disable movement
        Note: The horse continues moving with whatever velocity it has when stopped, and will gradually slow down
    In the initial submission, the horse was not moving correctly. We fixed this later, but you may want to mark it as if it was not functioning, as it was not functioning when we originally submitted.
